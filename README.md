# Hello-world
This is me - walking in to github for the first time.

I am an entrepreneur, pursuing my dreams constantly.
Always looking for a way to make it a better world for our decendents to live in.
Join me!

I am not a programmer (yet), and basically, I don't even know how to build a project on Github (YET!).
But I'm willing to do what it takes.

Will appreciate any advice, critic or new ideas.
Give me your opinion - I know you have one.
